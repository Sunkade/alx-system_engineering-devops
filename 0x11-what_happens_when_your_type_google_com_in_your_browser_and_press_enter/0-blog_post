DNS Request:
Your browser initiates a DNS (Domain Name System) request to translate "www.google.com" into an IP address.

TCP/IP:
After obtaining the IP address, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection is established to communicate with the server using the IP.

Firewall:
The request passes through any firewalls, which are security barriers that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic

HTTPS/SSL:
If the website uses HTTPS, a secure connection is established using SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt data transmission between your browser and the server.

Load-Balancer:
For large-scale websites like Google, a load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overload.

Web Server:
The web server processes the request, retrieves the requested resources, and sends them back to your browser.

Application Server:
In some cases, an application server may be involved, handling dynamic content generation or processing more complex requests.

Database:
If the request involves retrieving or storing data, a database server may be accessed to fulfill the query.
